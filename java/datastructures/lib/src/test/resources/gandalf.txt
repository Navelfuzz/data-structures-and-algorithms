All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff.
He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his
long white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.
“Good Morning!” said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the
grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy
eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.
“What do you mean?” he said. “Do you wish me a good morning, or mean
that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this
morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?”
“All of them at once,” said Bilbo. “And a very fine morning for a pipe of
tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and
have a fill of mine! There’s no hurry, we have all the day before us!” Then Bilbo
sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey
ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over
The Hill.
“Very pretty!” said Gandalf. “But I have no time to blow smoke-rings this
morning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging,
and it’s very difficult to find anyone.”
“I should think so—in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for
adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I
can’t think what anybody sees in them,” said our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one
thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smoke-ring. Then he
took out his morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take no more
notice of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and wanted
him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and
gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable
and even a little cross.
“Good morning!” he said at last. “We don’t want any adventures here, thank
you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water.” By this he meant that the
conversation was at an end.
“What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!” said Gandalf. “Now you
mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won’t be good till I move off.”
“Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don’t think I know your
name?”
“Yes, yes, my dear sir—and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And
you do know my name, though you don’t remember that I belong to it. I am
Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I should have lived to be goodmorninged
by Belladonna Took’s son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!”
