# Code Challenge: Class 32 - Tree Intersection

**Feature Tasks**
* Write a function called `tree_intersection` that takes two binary trees as parameters.
* Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

**Structure and Testing**
* Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component 
parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex 
algorithm in one function definition.
* Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
* Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.


**Stretch Goal**
* Describe how you might solve this differently if the parameters were Binary Search Trees.
    * What are the potential efficiency differences?
