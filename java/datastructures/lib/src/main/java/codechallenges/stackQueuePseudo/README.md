# Challenge: CLass 11

**Branch Name**: stack-queue-pseudo

**Challenge Type**: Code Challenge/Algorithm

### Feature Tasks: 

1. ***Create a new class called pseudo queue.***
   * Do not use an existing Queue.
   * Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below)
   * Internally, utilize 2 `Stack` instances to create and manage the queue.

2. ***Methods***:
    * enqueue
      * Arguments: value
      * Inserts a value into the PseudoQueue, using a FIFO approach
    * dequeue
      * Arguments: none
      * Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a FIFO approach.

        
**NOTE**: The `Stack` instances have only `push`, `pop`, and `peek` methods. You should use your own stack implementation.
Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.
