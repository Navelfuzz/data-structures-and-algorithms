# Code Challenge: Class 05: Linked List Implementation
Create a Node class and Linked List class

## Whiteboard Process
N/a

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Created the following classes: Node & LinkedList

### Node Class

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

### LinkedList Class 
* Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
* Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
 * The class should contain the following methods: 
   * insert
     * Arguments: value
     * Returns: nothing
     * Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
   * includes
     * Arguments: value
     * Returns: Boolean
       * Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
   * to string
     * Arguments: none
     * Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
     * `"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"`
