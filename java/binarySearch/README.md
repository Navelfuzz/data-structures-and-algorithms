# Code Challenge: Class 03

This assignment is a whiteboarding task to whiteboard a BinarySearch function in Java that takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without using any of the built-in methods available to the language, return the index of the array's element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.
